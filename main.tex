\section{Mashups}
\label{sec:mash}

Describe mashups, difficulties in mashup security and information flows in mashups.

% 2-3 pages 
\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:arch}

Describe various monitor distribution techniques.

\subsection{Shadowing}

Inline the monitor into the JavaScript code. Appealing idea, previous work for 
toy languages, but difficult in practice. Abandoned due to complexity with 
coercion in expressions.

\subsection{Plugin}

Plugin replaces JavaScript interpretation. Install plugin and you're done.
\begin{itemize}
\item- Browser dependent
- Intrusive to the browser
- Cumbersome for user to setup/configure
- General, every browsed page
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proxy}

Proxy injects monitor into every page and wraps all JavaScript. Setup the proxy 
and you're done.
- Practically the same monitor as the plugin
- Browser independent
- Less intrusive to the browser, simple proxy setup
- Less cumbersome to setup
- Server-side configuration
- General, every browsed page

\subsection{Service}

Service injects browsed pages with the monitor and references to itself, and 
wraps all JavaScript. Browse through service and you're done.
- More intrusive in HTML content, rewrite links and external references 
- Browser independent
- Not intrusive to the browser
- Even less cumbersome to setup, browse to server URL
- Server-side and client-side configuration possible
- Less general, only browsed pages

\subsection{Integrator}

The mashup integrator includes the monitor and decides which JavaScript should 
run within the monitor. (Don't mention sandbox.) You're done.
- No setup
- Not intrusive to the browser
- Not general
- Deliberately intrusive to HTML
- Integrator configuration, no user control
- Run independent part of the code outside the monitor, possible performance gains

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

Describe features and drawbacks with each implementation.

\subsection{Plugin}

- rewrite all or some, client-side configuration
- innerHTML
- difficult to mimic execution order in the page parsing
- document.write
- firefox challenges
- execution order (script inclusion heavy but possible)
- execution contexts no problem (SVG and CSS uses native JavaScript)

\subsection{Proxy}

- rewrite all or nothing, problem with passing configuration to proxy
- DOM parsing to find scripts, compared to regular expressions
- difficult to identify all contexts (SVG, CSS and PDF can be rewritten, not flash)

\subsection{Service}

- rewrite all or some, can pass configuration through cookie
- piggybacking, wildcard DNS compared to URL parameter
- disable SOP, domain relaxing
- DOM parsing to find scripts, compared to regular expressions
- difficult to identify all contexts (SVG, CSS and PDF can be rewritten, not flash)

\subsection{Integrator}

- rewrite some, integrator driven, no or limited user configuration
- no need for parsing, integrator decides
- well defined per site policy
- site could allow user to configure policy
- requires developer understanding of the monitor
- future reflection of monitored code?
