Describe various monitor distribution techniques.

% Design choices and motivation

\subsection{Shadowing}

Inline the monitor into the JavaScript code. Appealing idea, previous work for 
toy languages, but difficult in practice. Abandoned due to complexity with 
coercion in expressions.

\subsection{Plugin}

Plugin replaces JavaScript interpretation. Install plugin and you're done.
\begin{itemize}
\item- Browser dependent
\item- Intrusive to the browser
\item- Cumbersome for user to setup/configure
\item- General, every browsed page
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proxy}

Proxy injects monitor into every page and wraps all JavaScript. Setup the proxy 
and you're done.
\begin{itemize}
\item- Practically the same monitor as the plugin
\item- Browser independent
\item- Less intrusive to the browser, simple proxy setup
\item- Less cumbersome to setup
\item- Server-side configuration
\item- General, every browsed page
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Service}

Service injects browsed pages with the monitor and references to itself, and 
wraps all JavaScript. Browse through service and you're done.
\begin{itemize}
\item- More intrusive in HTML content, rewrite links and external references 
\item- Browser independent
\item- Not intrusive to the browser
\item- Even less cumbersome to setup, browse to server URL
\item- Server-side and client-side configuration possible
\item- Less general, only browsed pages
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integrator}

The mashup integrator includes the monitor and decides which JavaScript should 
run within the monitor. (Don't mention sandbox.) You're done.
\begin{itemize}
\item- No setup
\item- Not intrusive to the browser
\item- Not general
\item- Deliberately intrusive to HTML
\item- Integrator configuration, no user control
\item- Run independent part of the code outside the monitor, possible performance gains
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

Describe features and drawbacks with each implementation.

% Implementation details

\subsection{Plugin}

\begin{itemize}
\item- rewrite all or some, client-side configuration
\item- innerHTML
\item- difficult to mimic execution order in the page parsing
\item- document.write
\item- firefox challenges
\item- execution order (script inclusion heavy but possible)
\item- execution contexts no problem (SVG and CSS uses native JavaScript)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTTP Proxy}

\begin{itemize}
\item- Proxy implemented in NodeJS
\item- rewrite all or nothing, problem with passing configuration to proxy
\item- DOM parsing to find scripts, compared to regular expressions
\item- difficult to identify all contexts (SVG, CSS and PDF can be rewritten, not flash)
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Web proxy (Service)}

\begin{itemize}
\item- rewrite all or some, can pass configuration through cookie
\item- piggybacking, wildcard DNS compared to URL parameter
\item- disable SOP, domain relaxing
\item- DOM parsing to find scripts, compared to regular expressions
\item- difficult to identify all contexts (SVG, CSS and PDF can be rewritten, not flash)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integrator}

\begin{itemize}
\item- rewrite some, integrator driven, no or limited user configuration
\item- no need for parsing, integrator decides
\item- well defined per site policy
\item- site could allow user to configure policy
\item- requires developer understanding of the monitor
\item- future reflection of monitored code?
\end{itemize}
